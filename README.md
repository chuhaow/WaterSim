# Water Simulation

An expoloration of water simulation techniques used in graphical programming

## Description

Two techniques for water simulation were used in this project. The first is a simple Sum of Sines technique. With the Sum of Sines technique I was able to produce a highly stylisted simulation of water as well as a low fedility simulation.

The second technique explored was the FFT technique. With this technique I was able to achieve a highly realistic simulation of the ocean akin to the ocean in Sea of Thieves. Please see the following videos
