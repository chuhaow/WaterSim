# Water Simulation

An exploration of water simulation techniques used in graphical programming

## Description

Two techniques for water simulation were used in this project. The first is a simple Sum of Sines technique. With the Sum of Sines technique I was able to produce a highly stylisted simulation of water as well as a low fidelity  simulation using sum of sine and Fractional Brownian Motion.

Please Note the artifacts in the gif above are due to the capturing software used and does not happen in the simulation

The second technique explored was the FFT technique. With this technique I was able to achieve a highly realistic simulation of the ocean akin to the ocean in Sea of Thieves. Please see the following videos
